  {name: "About", content: "<h2>The Care and Feeding of the Urban Sloth</h2>\r\n<h3>An editorial</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Urban Sloth:</h4>\r\n<div class=\"well\">\r\n  <p>Primarily nocturnal, preferring to stay in bed as long as they can in the\r\n  morning and staying up as late as they can (get away with) at night.</p>\r\n  <p>Physically slow moving can appear lazy most of the time. </p>\r\n  <p>Mentally fast moving, even though they may appear slow. This is evidenced by\r\n  their ability to carry on several conversations on MSN at any on time and\r\n  their skill at video games that goes far beyond our comprehension.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>These will help you identify an Urban Sloth in your house but for easy\r\nidentification let's look to a couple of scenarios;</p>\r\n<div class=\"well\">\r\n  <p>Parent: \"you should ride to your bike to baseball practice\"</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Child: \"no way! It will take 20 minutes to get there, it's too far, and I\r\n  will be too tired to practice when I get there\".</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>See if this sounds familiar,</p>\r\n<div class=\"well\">\r\n  <p>Father: \"the grass needs to be cut today\"</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Son: do I half to?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Father: yes, it needs it, and don't forget to do the edging.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Son: the edging! Why?</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Father: because it needs it, oh and I want you to bag the grass this time,\r\n  don't mulch.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>Son: Bag the grass?....</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This continues in the theme of litigation until finally one of you gives in.\r\nThe sad part is that it is only a 1 hour job and they earn $5 of their\r\nallowance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is different than when we were growing up. And it is almost impossible\r\nto understand if you grew up in a small town or on the farm.\r\nThe work ethic is still vastly different today between Urban and Rural\r\nupbringing. As an employer I would chose the candidate who was raised\r\nrurally even if it meant extra training was required for them to do the job.\r\nWhy? you may ask, simply because they are coming with a stronger work ethic,\r\npersonal motivation and resilience (stick-to-it-iveness).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can we do about it?</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Feeding;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to each create our own answers. Just as each of our children is\r\ndeferent so must our approaches be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's start by understanding some of the differences between Urban and Rural\r\nupbringing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We say to our kids \"you have it so easy, why when I was your age...\" We say\r\nthis because it is likely true, our parents said it to us, their parents\r\nsaid it to them and so on through the generations, but is it really true?</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What is life like for our adolescents today?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Both parents are working more than 40 hours a week, add to that drive time\r\nto and from work and you have the recipe for complications. If you were\r\nblessed with more than one child then you are juggling music lessons, dance,\r\nsoccer, baseball, intramurals and your own evening commitments for work,\r\nvolunteer roles and trying to hold onto some semblance of a social life, oh\r\nand lest we forget, time to actually sit down and have a real conversation\r\nwith your spouse. So...when do you have idle time? Time for your kids to\r\ntalk freely to you without time constraints, time when you can listen to\r\nthem uninterrupted, undistracted without an agenda for what you want to\r\nhear? Well that's a trick we all need to master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very good friend of mine who was the Director of a boy's home in Ontario\r\nfor a decade and a half gave me the best advice I have ever had. I called\r\nhim one night when I was ready to pull my hair out; I was at my wits end\r\nwith my then 11 year old son. Ken listened to me rant and rave for what\r\nprobably seemed like hours for him. When I finally gave him a chance to talk\r\nhe asked me \"do you ever have father-son-time? Sure! I replied. \"how often\"?\r\nHe said Oh all the time was my answer. No, he said, I mean time when you\r\nleave the house with him, just the two of you and you just shut up and\r\nlisten to him without your own agenda? I sheepishly said no?... \"Well, he\r\nsaid, take your son out for hot chocolate or to the book store once a week,\r\nsit down and let him talk, even if there are long periods of silence, let\r\nthem happen. He needs to know that he is only talking on his agenda. You'll\r\nbe surprised where it will lead and the things you would otherwise not find\r\nout. Try this for the winter and call me next summer to tell me how happy\r\nyou are\". It's now 4 years later and I find myself filed with pride, not\r\nfrustration. He is still an Urban Sloth, but Rome wasn't built in a day,\r\nbaby steps.baby steps.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We expect our kids to grow up with an outlook on life and a work ethic that\r\nmirrors our own but they are rarely witness to it, so how can they model it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's get back to the Urban Sloth for a moment. I think we can all agree\r\nthat we had the best work ethic back when we grew up on the farm, in our\r\nfamily business or went to work with our parents regularly. And it is at\r\nit's worst when we were for the most part isolated from our parents, they\r\nboth worked outside the house for long hours and in the evening we were busy\r\nfrom soccer to dance or they came home and needed their \"space\" or\r\n\"downtime. The differences are pretty drastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what has changed, we are too busy to listen to our kids and know\r\nthem, and they are distanced from us. They don't see us on-our-game because\r\nwe are too tired when we come home and we need our unwind time. We don't\r\nhave much time to be good role models, we I believe our kids are more like\r\nsloth's simply because we are not with them showing them our work ethic.\r\nThey can't see it, we are gone without them to work. What they do see is a\r\nparent moving so fast they are just a blur. Our kids today largely need to\r\nunderstand our work ethic, by proxy, and that is a tough job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is easy and convenient for us the say \"it's not my fault\", society\r\ndemands our life to be so busy\", \"I can't do my job in only 40 hours a\r\nweek\". </p>\r\n<p>Well what kind of example are we giving our kids? Do as I say, not as I do,\r\ndon't take ownership for your actions, deflect the blame\". If everything\r\nwith you is going smooth, we won't take the time to talk, but if you're\r\ncausing trouble you can bet your sweet Xbox that we will be in your face\r\nuntil things are smooth again, and you don't need our attention.\r\nLet's add to this some of the societal influences; if you cannot be right,\r\nbe wrong at the top of your lungs\" this they learn from lobby groups who do\r\nnot reflect the majority opinion but still get what they want. If you lie\r\ncheat or get nailed for tax evasion you can still achieve public office. Or,\r\nmy personal favorite; you can take over you neighbors sand box and control\r\ntheir toys  if you think they were going to try and break yours some time in\r\nthe future, even if you had no proof of their ill intent (George W Bush).\r\nWe can blame Government, the work place and even the North American Culture\r\nfor blessing us with an Urban Sloth, but when you come right down to it, we\r\nmade the government, the work place and most of all the culture so if there\r\nare going to be changes, it is up to us to make the changes happen, right\r\nhere, right now, in our own homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, catch your kids doing something right and hug them because of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the time to talk to them one on one and listen, don't do the 20\r\nquestions thing just shut up and see where they want to take the\r\nconversation. And hug them just for the heck of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get on the same page with your spouse regarding rules and expectations for\r\nthe kids because kids look for chinks in the amour of the parents so they\r\ncan get their own way (much like lobby groups).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get involved in their life, in the things that mater, maybe it's\r\nvolunteering in soccer, gymnastics etc. maybe it's being an active member of\r\nthe PA or the School Board or maybe it's as simple as just showing up for\r\nthe meetings that have a direct effect on your child's life (most of us blow\r\nthis one).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to see the Urban Sloth on the endangered species list soon or\r\nat least in my lifetime. Let us work together to make this happen.</p>"},
